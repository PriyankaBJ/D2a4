1.     Explain hadoop in layman's term.

 
Hadoop is an open source, Java-based programming framework that supports the processing and storage of extremely large data sets in a distributed computing environment.

   Hadoop makes it possible to run applications on systems with thousands of commodity hardware nodes, and to handle thousands of terabytes of data. Its distributed file system facilitates rapid data transfer rates among nodes and allows the system to continue operating in case of a node failure. This approach lowers the risk of catastrophic system failure and unexpected data loss, even if a significant number of nodes become inoperative. Consequently, Hadoop quickly emerged as a foundation for big data processing tasks, such as scientific analytics, business and sales planning, and processing enormous volumes of sensor data, including from internet of things sensors.

 

2.     Explain the components of Hadoop framework.

 

The 3 core components of the Apache Software Foundation’s Hadoop framework are:
·        MapReduce – 
         A software programming model for processing large sets of data in parallel

·        HDFS –
         (Hadoop Distributed File System) 
         The Java-based distributed file system that can store all kinds of data without prior organization.

·        YARN –
         (Yet Another Resource Negotiater)
         It is a resource management framework for scheduling and handling resource requests from distributed applications.
         
           There is one notable difference with other popular file systems, which is, when we move a file in HDFS, it is automatically split into smaller files. These smaller files are then replicated on a minimum of three different servers, so that they can be used as an alternative to unforeseen circumstances. This replication count isn’t necessarily hard-set, and can be decided upon as per requirements.
 

 
 
 
                                
 
3.     Explain the reasons to learn Big data technologies.
